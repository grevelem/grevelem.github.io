                    <h1><strong>Merry Christmas!</strong></h1>
                    <p>First of all, I think now may be a good time to let you all know I'm not great with sentimental gifts. Shocker. Hence why your gift is being given to you in the form of hard code (nice, eh?).</p>
                    
                    <p>I spent a lot of quality time deep in google searches looking for things you might like. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Halle: Pasta Maker, pasta products, pasta utensils, pasta art, macaroni necklace kits.</li>
                        <li>Melanie: Ireland, as a collective whole (tried buying it, no dice. Considering getting you a potato but I thought that would be rude), Star wars anything, Dirndl attire, anything Bavaria related, and lastly heavy objects to throw at Emily. </li>
                        <li>Kayla: Web Toed Socks, dog clothing, dog toys, dog books, dog videos, dog photos, dog accessories and apparently... mushroom gardens.</li>
                        <li>Demi: Puppies, Wine, Records and old things, Wine. Puppies. Wine. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>And thought I thought to myself, if I am the cause for Halle's noodle addiction (and the ungodly amount of noodle leftovers we seem to hoard in the fridge) then I think I'd rather just... to be blunt, die.  Lawddddd Jesus take me now.</p>
                    
                    <p>With that being said, thank you guys for everything. For first and foremost, dealing with my nonsense (including, but not limited to: bath tub Scuba adventures, smokey potato experiments, my complete disregard for my tolerance (or lacke of)Craft Beer, and lets not forget the bitter sass that seems to control my entire existence.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm thankful to have such amazing friends that have helped make the transition here so easy. I'm very lucky and blessed to have each one of you in my life. </p>
                    
                    <h1>NOW THE GOOD STUFF</h1>
                    <p>You're cordially invited to a weekend adventure to Chicago, Illinois. The hotel, and dinner, are on me. </p>
                    <p> We will be staying at the AC HOTEL in Downtown Chicago, right off the miracle mile on a date of your choosing. </p>
                    
                    <p>Love ya dudes. Merry Christmas.</p>
                    <p>E-Dawg</p>
