    <h1>Atlassian and JIRA Technology</h1>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The web is a big place. Sometimes project tools are necessary to keep projects within a given community or business organized and in working order. That is where Atlassian comes into play.  Atlassian is a company that specializes in creating software to be used among teams. The company’s goal is to create “software to plan, collaborate, code and service” (“Software Development”). With that, comes JIRA. While Atlassian has multiple different products that allow for collaboration among web developers, I’ve chosen to focus on JIRA software specifically and how its technology stack allows users to efficiently track project progress and interact with fellow developers in a systematic way that allows for ease of communication and organization among project members. </p>
    <p>JIRA is a an issue and project tracking and online collaboration software designed to “prioritize, assign, track, report, and audit your ‘issues’ from software bugs and helpdesk tickets to project tasks and change requests”(Sim, 2009). Aside from bug/change request tracking it also has a system in place that allows for project management, individual task tracking, and workflow and process management.</p>
    <p>As a web developer at SNWorks through The State News, I have personal experience with JIRA, as well as other Atlassian products such as Confluence, HipChat, and Bitbucket, which were all created to work with one another to assist with collaboration among web development projects. JIRA allows for coordination between workers. Together we are able to track progress on bug fixes or support issues assigned to us when working on client websites. It allows us to communicate directly with other employees, or the client himself/herself, through a comment system, and allows us to track work and log hours on tickets created by project managers that give descriptions on what needs to be fixed and when the task needs to be completed by. In turn, this software allows the business to function smoothly and in a way that promotes quality work and coordination between both employees and clients.</p>
    <p>But what makes up JIRA’s technology stack? Designed to exemplify organization, “JIRA delivers real-time, relevant information in a convenient format” (Sim, 2009). Ease of use is key to assuring that businesses can effectively format and manage projects effectively through this software system. JIRA and Atlassian as a whole, offer plenty of different options in terms of servers, special software, and deployment strategies that allow the user/business to cater the management system exactly to their needs. For starters, Atlassian has two different options when it comes to using database servers. On the Atlassian website, it is recommended that a company uses an “external database for production systems” but also offers “an internal/bundled HSQL database” that can be used (“Configuring Security”). Deployment strategies also vary depending on your company’s needs. Atlassian offers cloud hosting at a monthly rate depending on what type of tracking, sharing, and testing services a business is looking for (“Software Development”). If a company is not interested in a cloud subscription, Atlassian offers a flat rate for server licenses that a company can purchase and use themselves (“Software Development”). Atlassian also “strongly believes in open source software”(“Open source”). On their website it specifically states that they “support and contribute to the open source community in a number of ways – supplying (their) own code, supporting other projects by donating (their) software, and sponsoring Java User Groups”(“Open Source”). Some of Atlassian’s most popular open-source software projects are JIRA, Confluence, FishEye, Apache and Bamboo (“Open Source”). As mentioned before, Atlassian offers other special software aside from JIRA that aid companies in online collaboration. To name a few, Bitbucket, HipChat, and Confluence are a few of the more popular Atlassian products. To touch briefly on each of these and what they do to assist in project management, HipChat is essentially an online instant messaging chat forum that allows for real-time collaboration between individuals, groups or teams. It can be used for video calling, screen sharing, file sharing and general discussion and can be used on any mobile device which allows team members to be connected instantly at all times (“Bring Your Team to Life”). Bitbucket is a hosting service created by Atlassian that allows for code sharing within repositories that allow for projects and teams to collaborate, revise, and work on projects together. Confluence is essentially a place for group members to collaborate and share information, much like Google docs, that allows group members to communicate, edit, and contribute to central documents all located in one place. HipChat, BitBucket, Confluence, and JIRA can all be integrated together to work as a collective whole.</p>
    <p>Because Atlassian relies heavily on providing a content management system, security can be changed on multiple different levels of the differing software both internally and externally. Internally, Global permissions refer to who can and cannot log in. Project permissions revolve around who can edit, see, and assign projects. Issue security levels allow administrators to adjust who can and cannot see individual issues. Comment visibility and work-log visibility are also capable of being changed depending on the administrator’s discretion. External security depends on the type of database you’ve chosen to use with JIRA. If using an external database, it is recommended that you restrict access to the database that your JIRA instance uses (“When Work Becomes Teamwork”). Permissions can be changed in almost every aspect of the internal security.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, Atlassian has created a group of products that allow for ease of collaboration among web developers. Whether it’s JIRA, BitBucket, HipChat, or the plethora of other software products available, Atlassian has provided a system of different open-source, secure collaboration and development tools that allow web developers to work together and collaborate in a way that that caters to productivity and idea sharing among group members.</p>
